# ðŸª™ Pence to pounds

## Problem statement

If weâ€™re given a price in pence, like 105p, we want to work out the same price but **in pounds**. In the case of 105p, this price would be 1.05 as we divide the number of pence by 100 to get the price in pounds. 

## Expected behaviour

### Function call

`convertToPounds(105)`

`convertToPounds(235)`

### Expected output

`"Â£1.05"`

`"Â£2.35"`
