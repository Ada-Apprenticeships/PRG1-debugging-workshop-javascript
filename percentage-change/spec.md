# ðŸ§® Calculate percentage change

## Problem statement

Letâ€™s suppose we start with an original value of 100 pounds. If we then increase this value to get 130 pounds then we can ask how much has the original quantity increased by? In this case, 100 pounds has increased by 30% of its original value so we get 100 + 30 to gain 130. percentage change tells us the the percentage by which the original changed o get the new value.
