# ðŸ’¯ Calculate percentage change

## Problem statement

In many real-world scenarios, we need to understand how a value has changed relative to its original amount. This change is often expressed as a percentage. For example, if a stock price goes from $100 to $120, we might say it increased by 20%. We need a way to calculate this percentage change between two values, whether it's an increase or a decrease.

## Expected behaviour

Let's say we're implementing a function called `calculate_percentage_change`. The function `calculate_percentage_change` should take two parameters: the original value and the new value. It should return the percentage change as a number (positive for increases, negative for decreases), not including the percentage symbol. The result should be rounded to the nearest whole number.

We expect `calculate_percentage_change` to behave in the following way:

```python
calculate_percentage_change(100, 120)  # should return 20 (because it's a 20% increase)
calculate_percentage_change(50, 40)  # should return -20 (because it's a 20% decrease)
calculate_percentage_change(200, 200)  # should return 0 (because there's no change)
calculate_percentage_change(100, 150)  # should return 50 (because it's a 50% increase)
```
