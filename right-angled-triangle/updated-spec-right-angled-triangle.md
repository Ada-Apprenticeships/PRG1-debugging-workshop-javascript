# üìê Draw right angled triangle

## Problem statement

In programming, we often need to create visual patterns using text characters. One common shape is a right-angled triangle. This triangle is characterized by having one 90-degree angle, with the right angle positioned at the bottom-left corner when drawn with text characters. The challenge is to create a function that can draw such a triangle of any size, using a simple character like '*' to form the shape.

## Expected behaviour

Let's say we're implementing a function called `draw_right_angled_triangle` to satisfy the problem statement.

The function should have one parameter:

- An integer `n` representing the height of the triangle (which will also be the length of the base)

The function should print the triangle to the console, with each line representing a row of the triangle. The triangle should have the following characteristics:

- The first row should have one '*'
- Each subsequent row should have one more '*' than the previous row
- The last row should have 'n' number of '*' characters
- The right angle of the triangle should be at the bottom-left corner

The function should work for any positive integer input, allowing for triangles of various sizes to be drawn.

We expect `draw_right_angled_triangle` to behave in the following way:

```python
draw_right_angled_triangle(3)  # should print:
```
```

```python
draw_right_angled_triangle(5)  # should print:

```

```python
draw_right_angled_triangle(1)  # should print:
```
```
*
```
