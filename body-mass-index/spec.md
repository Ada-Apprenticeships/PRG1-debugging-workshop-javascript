# ⚖️ Calculate body mass index 

## Problem statement

The BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.

For example, if you weigh 70kg (around 11 stone) and are 1.70m (around 5 foot 7 inches) tall, you work out your BMI by:

1. squaring your height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89
2. dividing your weight in kilograms: 70 ÷ 2.89 = 24.22

Your result will be displayed to one decimal place, for example, 24.2
