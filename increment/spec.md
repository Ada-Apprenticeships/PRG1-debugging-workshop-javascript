# âž• Increment

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing a function that increases a given number by 1.

## Expected behaviour

Let's implement a function called `increment` to solve this problem:

- Accept a single number as input.
- Add 1 to the input number.
- Return the result of this addition.

For example:

If given the input 5, the function should return 6.
If given the input -3, the function should return -2.
If given the input 0, the function should return 1.

Note that the function should be able to handle various types of numbers, including positive integers, negative integers, and zero. The function should always return a number that is exactly one more than the input number.
This problem statement provides a clear, language-agnostic description of what the increment function should accomplish. It outlines the expected behavior without specifying how it should be implemented in any particular programming language. Your students can use this as a guide when debugging the broken source code you provide them.
