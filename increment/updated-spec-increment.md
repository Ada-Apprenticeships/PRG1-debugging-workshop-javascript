# âž• Increment

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing a function that increases a given number by 1.

## Expected behaviour

Let's implement a function called `increment` to solve this problem:

- Accept a single number as input.
- Add 1 to the input number.
- Return the result of this addition.

For example:

```python
increment(5)  # should return 6
increment(-3)  # should return -2
increment(0)  # should return 1
```

Note that the function should be able to handle various types of numbers, including positive integers, negative integers, and zero. The function should always return a number that is exactly one more than the input number.
