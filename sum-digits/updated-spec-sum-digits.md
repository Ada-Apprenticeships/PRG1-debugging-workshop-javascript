# ðŸ§® Sum digits 

## Problem statement

Let's consider a number like 2024. Its digit sum is the sum of each digit in the number. In this case, the digit sum would be 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 to get 8. We need to find a way to calculate the digit sum for any number.

## Expected behaviour

Let's say we're implementing a function called sum_digits. We expect `sum_digits` to behave in the following way:

```python
sum_digits(103)  # should return 4 (because 1 + 0 + 3 = 4)
sum_digits(257)  # should return 14 (because 2 + 5 + 7 = 14)
```
