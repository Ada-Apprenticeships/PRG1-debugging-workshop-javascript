# ðŸ§µ Capitalise

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing a function that modifies the capitalization of a given input string. The function should change the first character of the input string to uppercase while leaving the rest of the characters in their original case.

## Expected behaviour

Let's say we're implementing a function called `capitalise` to solve the problem statement.

Your function `capitalise` should:

1. Accept a single string as input.
2. Capitalize the first character of the string if it's a letter.
3. Leave all other characters in their original case.
4. Return the transformed string.

For example:

```python
capitalise('hello')
```

- If given the input "hello", the function should return "Hello".
- If given the input "WORLD", the function should return "WORLD".
- If given the input "42 is the answer", the function should return "42 is the answer".
