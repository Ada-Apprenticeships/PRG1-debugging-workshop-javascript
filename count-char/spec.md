# ðŸ§® Count characters

## Problem statement

When working with strings, it's often necessary to count how many times a specific character appears within the text. This operation can be useful in various scenarios, such as analyzing text content, validating input, or solving word puzzles. We need a function that can efficiently count the occurrences of a given character in a string, considering both uppercase and lowercase instances of the character as distinct.

## Expected behaviour

Let's say we're implementing a function called `countChar`. We expect `countChar` to behave in the following way:

```js
countChar("hello", 'l') // should return 2
countChar("Mississippi", 's') // should return 4
countChar("Mississippi", 'p') // should return 2
countChar("Cassandra", 'a') // should return 3
countChar("Cassandra", 'A') // should return 1
countChar("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", 'o') // should return 4
countChar("", 'a') // should return 0
countChar("No matches here", 'z') // should return 0
```

The function should take two parameters:

1. A string in which to search for the character
2. A single character to search for

The function should return:

- An integer representing the number of times the specified character appears in the string

The function should adhere to the following rules:

- It should be case-sensitive (uppercase and lowercase characters are considered different)
- It should work with any printable character, including letters, numbers, and special characters
- It should handle empty strings correctly
- If the character is not found in the string, it should return 0
- It should count all occurrences of the character, even if they are consecutive
